I do think it is a waste to not use the ability of OPAQUE to derive a secret, but key derivation is not a goal for SASL (oddly enough, it would be very useful).  Encryption is a different matter, but that is what RFC 4422 talks about.\r\n\r\nAlso, installing a security layer is not optional, it is done without further negotiation.  I did not know that, but it makes sense.  The installation of the security layer *is* specific to a protocol, which then looks at the SASL mech and installs the security layer if it is part of the mech.  But this still means that mechanisms are either/or.  You clearly choose to make OPAQUE not do encryption by default, so it would require a variant mechanism to add it.\r\n\r\nSo I drop my attempts to incorporate encryption into OPAQUE.",
